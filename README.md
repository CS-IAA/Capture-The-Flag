# Capture-The-Flag
An Unreal Engine first-person three-dimensional game that I designed with blueprint scripting. The player spawns on their chosen blue or red team's base and is to fight their way into enemy territory and return with their flag. If they they get killed, they can respawn. However, if they die holding the flag, then the flag is returned to the enemy team's base. A point is awarded to the team for each time a player returns to their base with the opposing team's flag. The condition for victory is based on the selected game mode. There are four different game modes to choose from. A player can either host the game or find an existing server with the game already running.

Instructions:
  - Requires Microsoft Windows OS
  - You do not have to install Unreal Engine on your own
  - Unzip Files.zip and place the two folders in the same directory as CaptureTheFlag.exe
